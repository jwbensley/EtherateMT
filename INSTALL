/*
  -lpthread
  Compile with support for Pthreads

  -Wall
   Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
   At present this is -Wcomment, -Wtrigraphs, -Wmultichar and a warning about
   integer promotion causing a change of sign in "#if" expressions.  Note that
   many of the preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
   control them.

   -Wall turns on the following warning flags:
   -Waddress -Warray-bounds=1 (only with -O2) -Wc++11-compat  -Wc++14-compat -Wchar-subscripts -Wenum-compare (in C/ObjC; this is on by default in C++)
   -Wimplicit-int (C and Objective-C only) -Wimplicit-function-declaration (C and Objective-C only) -Wcomment -Wformat -Wmain (only for C/ObjC and unless
   -ffreestanding) -Wmaybe-uninitialized -Wmissing-braces (only for C/ObjC) -Wnonnull -Wopenmp-simd -Wparentheses -Wpointer-sign -Wreorder -Wreturn-type
   -Wsequence-point -Wsign-compare (only in C++) -Wstrict-aliasing -Wstrict-overflow=1 -Wswitch -Wtrigraphs -Wuninitialized -Wunknown-pragmas
   -Wunused-function -Wunused-label -Wunused-value -Wunused-variable -Wvolatile-register-var

  -Werror
   Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings will
   be rejected.

  -pedantic
   Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of them
   are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless code.

  -ftrapv
   This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
   multiplication operations.

  -O3
   With -O, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without
   performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.
  -O1 Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
   more memory for a large function.
  -O2 Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations that
   do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  As compared to -O, this option
   increases both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.
  -O3 Optimize yet more.

  -Wjump-misses-init
   Warn if a "goto" statement or a "switch" statement jumps forward across the
   initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a label after the
   variable has been initialized.

  -Wlogical-op
   Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions. This
   includes using logical operators in contexts where a bit-wise operator is
   likely to be expected.

  -Wshadow
   Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another variable,
   parameter, type, class member (in C++), or instance variable (in
   Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed.

  -Wformat=2
   -Wformat=1 checks calls to "printf" and "scanf", etc., to make sure that the
   arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string specified,
   and that the conversions specified in the format string make sense. This
   includes standard functions, and others specified by format attributes, in
   the "printf", "scanf", "strftime" and "strfmon" families. -Wformat=2 enables
   -Wformat=1 plus additional format checks, currently equivalent to -Wformat
   -Wformat-nonliteral -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k.

  -Wformat-signedness
   If -Wformat is specified, also warn if the format string requires an
   unsigned argument and the argument is signed and vice versa.

  -Wextra
   This enables some extra warning flags that are not enabled by -Wall.
   -Wclobbered -Wempty-body -Wignored-qualifiers -Wmissing-field-initializers
   -Wmissing-parameter-type (C only) -Wold-style-declaration (C only)
   -Woverride-init -Wsign-compare -Wtype-limits -Wuninitialized
   -Wunused-parameter (only with -Wunused or -Wall) -Wunused-but-set-parameter
   (only with -Wunused or -Wall).

  -Wdouble-promotion
   Give a warning when a value of type "float" is implicitly promoted to
   "double".  CPUs with a 32-bit "single-precision" floating-point unit
   implement "float" in hardware, but emulate "double" in software. On such a
   machine, doing computations using "double" values is much more expensive
   because of the overhead required for software emulation.

  -Winit-self
   Warn about uninitialized variables that are initialized with themselves.
   Note this option can only be used with the -Wuninitialized option.
   -Wuninitialized is included in -Wextra.

  -Wtrampolines
   Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions. A
   trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run time on
   the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to
   call the nested function indirectly. For some targets, it is made up of data
   only and thus requires no special treatment. But, for most targets, it is
   made up of code and thus requires the stack to be made executable in order
   for the program to work properly.

  -Wcast-qual
   Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from the
   target type. For example, warn if a "const char *" is cast to an ordinary
   "char *". Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in
   an unsafe way. For example, casting "char **" to "const char **" is unsafe.

  -Wcast-align
   Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment of the
   target is increased. For example, warn if a "char *" is cast to an "int *"
   on machines where integers can only be accessed at two- or four-byte
   boundaries.

  -Wwrite-strings
   When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[length]" so
   that copying the address of one into a non-"const" "char *" pointer produces
   a warning.  These warnings help you find at compile time code that can try
   to write into a string constant, but only if you have been very careful
   about using "const" in declarations and prototypes. Otherwise, it is just a
   nuisance. This is why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.

  -fsanitize=address
   Enable AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector. Memory access
   instructions are instrumented to detect out-of-bounds and use-after-free
   bugs.
   !! This will not work with Valgrind !!

/* Perform a "debug" compile - use with tools like val-/call-/cache-grind,
   GDB, perf etc */

gcc -o build/etherate_mt src/main.c -lpthread -fstack-protector-all -Og -g --std=c11

/*

  -fstack-protector-all
   Like -fstack-protector except that all functions are protected.

   Og:
   With -O, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution time, without
   performing any optimizations that take a great deal of compilation time.
  -O0
   Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected results.
   This is the default.
  -Og
   Optimize debugging experience. -Og enables optimizations that do not
   interfere with debugging. It should be the optimization level of choice for
   the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering a reasonable level of
   optimization while maintaining fast compilation and a good debugging
   experience.

  -g
   Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
   (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2). GDB can work with this debugging
   information.


  Valgrind:

  sudo valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --leak-resolution=high --track-origins=yes --expensive-definedness-checks=yes --track-fds=yes ./build/etherate_mt -I 3 -r

  --leak-check=full
   When enabled, search for memory leaks when the client program finishes.

  --show-leak-kinds=all
   Specifies the leak kinds to show in a full leak search.

  --leak-resolution=high
   When doing leak checking, determines how willing Memcheck is to consider
   different backtraces to be the same for the purposes of merging multiple
   leaks into a single leak report

  --track-origins=yes
   Controls whether Memcheck tracks the origin of uninitialised values.

  --expensive-definedness-checks=yes
   Controls whether Memcheck should employ more precise but also more expensive
   (time consuming) algorithms when checking the definedness of a value.

  --track-fds=yes
   When enabled, Valgrind will print out a list of open file descriptors on
   exit.


  Callgrind:

  sudo valgrind --tool=callgrind ./build/etherate_mt -I 3 -r

  callgrind_annotate ./callgrind.out.2974 /path/to/tests.cpp
  # or
  callgrind_annotate --auto=yes ./callgrind.out.2974


  Cachegrind:

  sudo valgrind --tool=cachegrind --branch-sim=yes ./build/etherate_mt -I 3 -r

  --branch-sim=yes
   Enables collection of branch instruction and misprediction counts.

  cg_annotate ./cachegrind-out /path/to/tests.cpp
  # or
  sudo kcachegrind cachegrind.out


  Perf:
  
  sudo perf stat ./buid/etherate_mt -I 1 -c 1

  sudo perf top
